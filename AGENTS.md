## 🎯 Final Notes

> "The goal of this repo isn't just to meet academic requirements — it's to demonstrate what's possible when AI, data, and vision come together to tell a compelling human story."

You're not just writing code — you're building something that will live as a personal showcase, a business foundation, and a resource for others.

Let’s keep it elegant, insightful, and human-centered.
