## 📚 **Overview**
This repository showcases my **Bachelor of Applied Science in Cybersecurity** through **data analysis and visual storytelling**. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I created **insightful visualizations** to track my GPA progression, grade distribution, and academic milestones.

The notebook, **CyberGrad--My-Cybersecurity-Degree-in-Data-&-Visuals.ipynb**, presents:
- 📈 **GPA Progression Over Time** – Tracking academic growth.
- 🎓 **Grade Distribution** – Understanding coursework performance.
- 🔥 **Heatmap Analysis** – Exploring grade trends in a different format.
- 💡 **Key Milestones** – Highlighting important academic achievements.
- 📝 **Cybersecurity Degree Image** – Displaying my official degree.
